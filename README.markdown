# Tinybinding

Tinybinding is a small framework that allows automated synchronization of values between objects including values of Swing Components.
The basic API design was largely inspired by [JFace Data Binding](wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace_Data_Binding) and extended to use more fluent elements and therefore create a simple, intuitive and type-safe API.
